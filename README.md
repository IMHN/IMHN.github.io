This is the source code behind [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com).

The  idea  of this  service  is  inspired from  [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com)
(formerly rawgithub.com). I just realized that using a whole framework (node.js
with express.js) for such simple thing as requests proxying is overkilling, and
made same stuff using nginx only.
